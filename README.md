# Pyth -
A simple project on data visualization based on the number of people killed, injured in road accidents in India using pandas and numpy libraries in Python.
Probably a very rudimentary project, to know how to code in this language. Consists of simple bar charts of accidents over the years in certain states in India by organizing data through a custom function.
